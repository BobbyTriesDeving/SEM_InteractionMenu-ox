# 👮 SEM INTERACTION MENU OX_LIB MENU 👮

This resource is __**SEM_Interaction Menu**__ by: https://github.com/Sc0ttM **(I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL CREATOR)**

This resource is built to give SEM Interaction a better feel and look. I have added Ox Skill Check to escape cuffs when you are in handcuffs. I have also updated all menu items (that are necessary) to use ox_lib when you click them. This is an open source resource and is free to be altered in anyway you would like. 

⭐ Starring my repos are always helpful and meaningful to me so thank you to anybody who stars my repo.

💻 **Installation**
This is a drag and drop resource. Open your server.cfg file, ensure/start SEM_InteractionMenu, then drag and drop the resource and it should set itself up. Please make sure ox_lib is installed and started before this resource on your server. If you fail to do this step the menu **WILL** break.
